I am awarding the Royal Meritorious Unit Citation to the HMS *Justicar* CA-404. The ship has been very active. In less than a year, they have recruited enough members to move up not just once, from a DD, but twice to their current level of Heavy Cruiser.

They are attending many cons both in Canada and the states. They are actively out recruiting and broadcasting the TRMN as a whole to Vancouver Island.

They have gone above and beyond the call of duty and needs to represent our organization and Victoria Station.


Congratulations to everyone! Great job!

By my Hand, July 2, 2017, in the name of Queen Elizabeth III.

Lady Chrissy Killian, OCN  
Admiral of the Green, RMN  
Commanding Officer, Tenth Fleet  
First Countess, Fontana Flats
