As I reflect back on my time in command of this fine chapter and those ships that laid the foundation for where we are today it reminds me of a saying "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" or I suppose more appeley of a thousand lightyears' which also is a fantastic way to describe the experience  of chapter command.  When we started our chapter back in may of 2016 with HMS Hellhound we had the belief that we could grow and set out a five year version of where we wanted to see our chapter go and many of those founding members today play a role in helping us to become what we are today. In time when reflecting back on 2016 little did we know that we would have more growth and by late september/ early october of 2016 we moved up to HMS Avalon our second ship with the end of the year going to OryCon our first international convention down in Portland.  

In turn HMS Avalon in 2017 helped us to show that we were doing something right and that forces seemed to be aligned to help out. Our first con in 2017 at Lantasy turned out to be a magical event where our booth number nearly matched our hull number and the look we wanted for our table displays came together. The time after Lantasy would set the pattern of attending conventions up and down Vancouver Island which helped us to become known among the convention scene and though recruiting new members it allowed us in May of 2017 to upgrade and commission HMS Justicar.

HMS Justicar kept the trend of showing up and knocking activities out of the park helping to grow our impact on Vancouver Island. The two proudest moments of our time as the Justicar for me were exploring the unknown region of Courtney/Comox when we went to CoVaCon in 2018 and attending Norwescon where we had to chance to again meet members of 10th fleet and during the con working on submitting information for the upgrade to the Centaur. CoVaCon also has a special place in my heart as pound for pound it has been one of the conventions that has helped us to get many new members and in 2018 alone we signed up five new members.   

Lastly, I take us out of a journey to the past and we come to HMS Centaur, our current ship. Getting a CLAC was the chapter's ultimate goal and not only did we achieve that but we did it under the Five years that we had set ourselves as a goal.  The reminder of 2018 and 2019 would help us to grow some more and carry on the tradition of working to have fun and be a chapter open to everyone. Another highlight of our time as the Centaur came in September of 2019 when several members of the ships crew went down to Rustycon to meet other members of 10th fleet and a chance to meet the creator of our series David Weber and his wife. While it turns out that 2020 will be a wash for the convention seen on Vancouver Island and 2020 turns into what could have been chapter life has gone on and will keep going on.  

In closing I want to thank several people for being around since the start. First, Robert Allen Day, thank you for wanting to be my XO and being a sounding board and a person who could help give our chapters a RCN favor. Second, Kyle Polkinghorne who could not be a better Bosun for a chapter and a better friend helping to guide our various chapters to the path we are on today. Third, Rowan Wilson who over time moved from Spacer 2nd to our first Officer and Chief Engineer who I might add is the best Chief Engineer in the fleet and now the Centaurâ€™s new XO. Lastly, Kevin Smith who without your hard work we could not have several of the designs of our ship crests and input that help our chapter to be better.   

To end Captain Day The Chair is yours
